# Getting started PHP sample application

This is a small php application to demonstrate PHP support at wercker. It
manages its dependencies via Composer and contains an integration test that
is executed with PHPUnit. The CI build pipeline is defined in the
[wercker.yml](https://github.com/wercker/getting-started-php/blob/master/wercker.yml)
file.

For more information about the PHP environment at wercker, see [PHP at
werckers devcenter](http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/languages/php.html).
